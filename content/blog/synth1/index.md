## Why build a synth

One of my passions is playing with synthesizers at home. I truly enjoy exploring the sounds that can be created with such a technological instrument. Almost all the modern music I enjoy incorporates a synth in some way; it's arguably the most significant instrument of the last decade. In recent years, I purchased the Serum digital synthesizer and delved deeply into programming sounds within the software.

However, what has always captured my attention are the circuits behind a synth, how it operates, and the possibility of building one. I began following the blog posts of Thea, a software engineer who constructs her modular synths with distinct approaches. My objective is to apply all the knowledge that I have in circuits to build my synth.

## What makes a sound a Sound? 

What truly defines a sound is its timbre. All sounds possess distinct musical characteristics, including pitch, volume, polyphony, and timbre. The pitch determines the note being played, corresponding to the frequency of the wave. Volume is straightforward, it represents the intensity of the sound.

Polyphony adds an interesting part to any musical instrument. While most instruments allow you to play multiple notes simultaneously (a C major chord on a piano is an excellent example), this isn't always the case with synths. For instance, one of the most iconic synth bass lines, the one in "Flashlight" by Parliament, is entirely monophonic.

However, the timbre truly defines a sound, the difference between the same note played on different instruments, the different waveforms that various synths can produce, and their unique characteristics. This is what I want to explore.

## Analog or digital? 

Now I need to plan the type of synthesizer that I want to build: digital or analog. Classic synthesizers are mostly analog, offering an ideal platform to explore the theory and practical aspects of building an electronic musical instrument. However, digital synthesizers have become the norm, at least in my experience, and their applications are more viable and stable.

There are challenges associated with building an analog synth, so I'm inclined to try my luck with digital (not a final decision). The important thing to note is that both types have advantages and disadvantages, and I'll base my decision on feasibility and utility.
